Android Constrained Widgets
===========================

This library offers a set of widgets that will respect a given aspect ratio while allowing to set relative dimensions.
For instance, you can have a layout that extends to the whole available width but whose height will be adjusted to always
keep a square shape.

## Demo

A demo of the widget is worth a thousand words. You can download it for free on Google Play.

## Usage 

The easiest way to get the library included in your project is by using Gradle. Simply add the following line to your dependencies block:

    dependencies {
        compile 'com.marvinlabs:android-constrained-widgets:1.0.+@aar'
    }
    
Of course, you can replace the version number by whichever version you need (you can have a look at this repository's tags to know which is the latest).
