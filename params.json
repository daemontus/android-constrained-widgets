{"name":"Android-constrained-widgets","tagline":"","body":"Android Constrained Widgets\r\n===========================\r\n\r\nThis library offers a set of widgets that will respect a given aspect ratio while allowing to set relative dimensions.\r\nFor instance, you can have a layout that extends to the whole available width but whose height will be adjusted to always\r\nkeep a square shape.\r\n\r\n## Demo\r\n\r\nA demo of the widget is worth a thousand words. You can download it for free on Google Play.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.marvinlabs.widget.constrained.demo\">\r\n  <img alt=\"Demo on Google Play\"\r\n         src=\"http://developer.android.com/images/brand/en_generic_rgb_wo_60.png\" />\r\n</a>\r\n\r\n## Usage \r\n\r\nThe easiest way to get the library included in your project is by using Gradle. Simply add the following line to your dependencies block:\r\n\r\n    dependencies {\r\n        compile 'com.marvinlabs:android-constrained-widgets:1.1.+@aar'\r\n    }\r\n    \r\nOf course, you can replace the version number by whichever version you need (you can have a look at this repository's tags to know which is the latest).\r\n\r\n## About Vincent & MarvinLabs\r\n\r\nI am a freelance developer located in Biarritz, France.
